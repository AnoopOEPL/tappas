## Download the SW Suite
To get started, go to the [Hailo Developer Zone](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/) and enter the [SW Suite download page](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/sw-downloads/). From there you can download your prefered version of the `Hailo SW Suite`. If this is your first time in the `Developer Zone`, you will be asked to register to the site before downloads are enabled, login and then you will be able to download the package.

## Install the SW Suite
Once the zip is downloaded, extract the folder with:   

```sh
tar -xf hailo_sw_suite_2022_01.tar.gz
```

You have three options for installing the `Suite`: **`Docker`** installation, **`Manual`** installation, and a **`Self Extractable`** installation.  
You can find instructions for all install flows, along with their required pre-requisites and sanity checks, [here in the Hailo Developer Zone](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/documentation/dataflow-compiler/latest/?sp_referrer=suite/suite_install.html).

And that's all you need! `TAPPAS` is included in the `SW Suite`, so by installing the `Suite` you should now have the corresponding version of `TAPPAS` installed inside.
