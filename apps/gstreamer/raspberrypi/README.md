# Raspberry Pi GStreamer based applications

## Where should I start?

That's a great question! Hailo provides a [Sanity Pipeline](sanity_pipeline/README.md) that helps you verify that the installation phase went well. This is a good starting point.

1. [Sanity Pipeline](sanity_pipeline/README.md) - Helps you verify that all the required components are installed correctly
2. [Detection](detection/README.md) - single-stream object detection pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
3. [Depth Estimation](depth_estimation/README.md) - single-stream depth estimation pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
4. [Multinetworks parallel](multinetworks_parallel/README.md) - single-stream multi-networks pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
5. [Pose Estimation](pose_estimation/../README.md) - Human pose estimation using `centerpose` network.
6. [Face Detection](face_detection/README.md) - Face detection application.
7. [Face Detection and Facial Landmarking Pipeline](cascading_networks/README.md) - Face detection and then facial landmarking.
8. [Classification](classification/README.md) - Classification app using `resnet_v1_50`.
